% QUESTION 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item This week's Problem of the Week in Math is described as follows:
\begin{quotation}
  \textit{There are thirty positive integers less than 100 that share a certain 
  property. Your friend, Blake, wrote them down in the table to the left. But 
  Blake made a mistake! One of the numbers listed is wrong and should be replaced 
  with another. Which number is incorrect, what should it be replaced with, and 
  why?}
\end{quotation}
The numbers are listed below.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    6 & 10 & 14 & 15 & 21\\
    22 & 26 & 33 & 34 & 35\\
    38 & 39 & 46 & 51 & 55\\
    57 & 58 & 62 & 65 & 69\\
    75 & 77 & 82 & 85 & 86\\
    87 & 91 & 93 & 94 & 95
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Use the fact that the ``certain'' property is that these numbers are all supposed
to be the product of \emph{unique} prime numbers to find and fix the mistake that
Blake made.\\
\textbf{Reminder:} Code your solution in an \texttt{R} script and copy it over
to this \texttt{.Rnw} file.\\
\textbf{Hint:} You may find the \verb|%in%| operator and the \verb|setdiff()| function to be helpful.\\

\textbf{Solution:} 


We know there are 30 integers that are the product of unique prime numbers. So, to solve this problem, we first want to create a vector of those 30 correct integers. I loaded the \texttt{primes} library and used the \texttt{generate\_primes()} function to do that generate a list of prime numbers, whose products I compared to Blake's list \citep{primes}. Before comparing the prime products, I cleaned my vector of prime prouducts so it would only include those of two \emph{unique} numbers with a product less than 100. 

We can then compare that list with Blake's list, using \texttt{setdiff()}, which outputs the value that is different between the two vectors. This outputs the wrong number in Blake's list and the missing correct number in our list. 

The wrong number in Blake's list was 75, while the corrrect number that is missing is 74.
